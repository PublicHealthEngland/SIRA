                      **kwargs):
    '''
    Function to explicitly run the modeling of a group of individuals, having
    been infected at some randomly distributed times prior, attempting to 
    take a flight to some destination country and subsequently trying to gain
    entry. Each infected person is allocated a randomly distributed 
    incubation period and a randomly distributed flight time. The model then 
    tests if each person has become symptomatic, according to their given 
    incubation period, prior to boarding flight (at origin border), on flight 
    (hence displaying symptoms at destination boarder), or not being 
    sypmtomatic on arrival (thus becoming a community case in the destination
    country). If an infected individual is detected as symptomatic at any 
    boarder, they are marked as "DETECTED" at this boarder and then removed
    from the model.

    Additional functionality has been added through the use of the parameters
    `second_screen` and `release_time`. These allow the user to simulate the 
    scenarion where travellers, after arriving at their destination border and
    undergoing their entry screening, must complete a period of self-
    isolation. They are then screened again at `second_screen` after their 
    initial screening. If they test positive here, they are then released at
    `release_time` after arrival. To deploy this feature, both parameters must
    be specified, else the model shall revert to its base function.
    
    The base model assumes that border screening is 100% effective at both the
    origin border and destination border, and thus travellers who are
    symptomatic prior to crossing of these borders will always be removed from
    the model. Use of the parameters "exit_scr_sens" and "entry_scr_sens" then 
    allows the users to introduce some probability of failure into these 
    processes. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    num_people : int
        Number of simulated infected persons to be modelled attempting to 
        travel to the destination country
    flight_dist :  numpy statsitical distribution function
         Distribution function to model the shape of the distribution of
         the flight time (in hours) from origin country, to destination country
         for infected individuals  
    inc_dist : numpy statsitical distribution function
        Distribution function to model the shape of the distribution of
        the incubation period (in hours) for given disease infecting travelling
        individuals
    exp_dist : numpy statsitical distribution function
        Distribution function to model the shape of the distribution of 
        times (in hours) taken from passengers becoming infected to 
        boarding flight to the destination country
    time_scale : str
        Parameter to define whether the incuabtion period has been defined over
        a scale of hours, or days, as model requires incubation period to be 
        given in the form of hours. Accepts values "hours" or "days"; if value 
        "days" is passed, the program will convert the incubation period from
        days to hours. If "hours" is given no further operation is undertaken.  
    reporting : bool
        True or False, describing whether user wishes for 
        detection/non-detection statistics to be printed to upon the completion
        of simulation
    full_output : bool
        True or False, describing whether users wishes for list containing
        the detection counts to be returned. List is returned in the form:
        [non-fliers-count, detected-on-arrival-count, 
        detected-at-second-test-count, 
        symptomatics-detected-before-release-count,
        non-detecteds-count]
    exit_scr_sens : float
        To take value in the semi-open range (0,1], specifying the exit 
        screening sensitivty; the probability that exit screening will detect
        symptomatic cases, and hence remove them from the model
    entry_scr_sens : float
        To take value in the semi-open range (0,1], specifying the entry 
        screening sensitivty; the probability that entry screening will detect
        symptomatic cases, and hence remove them from the model
    second_screen : float
        numerical value to, in the instance that a self-isolation period is 
        wished to be deployed in the model, specify at which time after the
        initial testing the traveller is to be tested again. Must be specified
        in conjunction with `release_time` for functionality to be implemented.
        TO BE GIVEN IN HOURS AFTER ARRIVAL INTO DESTINATION COUNTRY.
    release_time : float
        numerical value to, in the instance that a self-isolation period is 
        wished to be deployed in the model, specify at which time after the
        initial testing the traveller is set to be release (give they tested
        negative in both administered tests). Must be specified in conjunction
        with `second_screen` for functionality to be implemented. TO BE GIVEN 
        IN HOURS AFTER ARRIVAL INTO DESTINATION COUNTRY.
    asymp_prob : float or None
        Parameter to take value of either None, or float in the range (0, 1).
        This the describes the probability that modelled inidividuals are to 
        be asymptomatic. If assumes value None, sets individual to be 
        symptomatic as default
    **kwargs : dict
        Dictionary of dictionaries (with keys 'exp', 'inc' and 'flight') which
        contains the variables used to define the specific shape of the chosen
        input distributions for exp_dist, inc_dist and flight_dist.
    
    Returns
    -------
    detected_ratio : float
        Value describing the ratio of infected persons detected at the boarder
        of the destination country, compared to the amount of infected persons 
        who successfully travel to the detsination country
